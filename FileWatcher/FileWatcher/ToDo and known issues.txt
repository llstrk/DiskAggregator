-- To do --

-- Issues --
If an existing tempdir is found, it's not checked if there's enough space on it before copying
Sometimes it seems like the update or move threads dissapear with no exceptions. Moved them to their own threads, instead of the timer, for easier troubleshooting
Doesn't check if folder already exists on another drive
Make a file system watcher for the share folder, so that the move timer only starts when there's new content

-- Possible features --
Only run moverThread if new files are actually detected, instead of every minute
Do more granular file system updates, instead of quering all folders everytime
Keep a cache of all folders, to prevent unnecessary spinning up harddrives when finding a new location, or looking for temp dirs
Limit how fast the program will write data to the disks (for example, be able to choose 10MB/sec maximum)
Rebalance storage (if one disk uses more disk space than the others, try to move storage from it to the others)
Balance based on disk capacity (right now it will put the same amount of data on a 500GB and a 4TB drive)
