-- To do --
Check for and remove broken links


-- Issues --
If an existing tempdir is found, it's not checked if there's enough space on it before copying
Sometimes it seems like the update or move threads dissapear with no exceptions. Moved them to their own threads, instead of the timer, for easier troubleshooting
Doesn't check if folder already exists on another drive

-- Possible features --
Do more granular file system updates, instead of quering all folders everytime
Keep a cache of all folders, to prevent unnecessary spinning up harddrives when finding a new location, or looking for temp dirs
Limit how fast the program will write data to the disks (for example, be able to choose 10MB/sec maximum)
